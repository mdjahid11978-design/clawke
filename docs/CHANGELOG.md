<!-- CHANGELOG_START -->

## v1.1.15 (2026-04-29)

**[New Feature]** Hermes gateway support.
- Added Hermes gateway integration so Clawke can connect to Hermes-backed agent sessions.
- Added Hermes model and skill discovery through the gateway layer.

**[New Feature]** Native management pages for skills and tasks.
- Added Skills Center support for listing, searching, creating, editing, disabling, and deleting managed skills.
- Added task management UI and APIs for viewing, triggering, and managing agent-side tasks without moving execution into Clawke.

**[Enhancement]** Gateway-backed resource discovery and translation.
- Moved model and skill metadata reads to gateway-backed APIs.
- Added gateway system sessions for background translation and refresh flows.
- Added batch translation, cache reuse, and detailed logs to make production diagnosis easier.

**[Bug Fix]** OpenClaw model routing and startup configuration.
- Fixed OpenClaw model switching to align with the dispatcher API.
- Fixed gateway model metadata fallback and channel configuration writing during install.
- Hardened startup behavior for gateways that do not provide a runnable start command.

**[Architecture]** Broader gateway test and release coverage.
- Added regression tests for OpenClaw, Hermes, nanobot, skill management, task management, and gateway system requests.
- Added UI E2E harness and high-priority cases for conversation settings, skills, tasks, approvals, choices, and streaming replies.

## v1.1.5 (2026-04-18)

**[New Feature]** One-click installation and unified CLI commands.
- Introduced `curl` based one-click install script for easy setup.
- Added `npx clawke server <start|stop|restart|status>` commands for better server management.
- Enabled password manager auto-fill hints for login and signup inputs on mobile.

**[New Feature]** AI typing status indicators.
- Added smooth spinner and status text to indicate when the AI is processing or typing.
- Built-in bilingual changelog generation workflow.

**[Enhancement]** Gateway pipeline optimizations.
- Upgraded gateway protocol handling with detailed delivery tracking and message compaction.
- Centralized logger and comprehensive state documentation for gateways.

**[Bug Fix]** Comprehensive abort (stop generation) pipeline overhaul.
- Fixed 3-layer abort synchronization across client, server, and gateway.
- Cancel queued messages immediately upon abort to prevent them from executing later.
- Fixed issue where AI would incorrectly "remember" and refer to the user's aborted requests.
- Corrected account ID forwarding during abort operations.

**[Bug Fix]** Fixed concurrent message and delivery state issues.
- Fixed an issue where the LLM becomes unresponsive when multiple tasks are sent concurrently.
- Fixed duplicate messages bug by implementing `disableBlockStreaming` constraints.
- Resolved a sequence boundary error where the client would miss messages if `client_last_seq > server_currentSeq`.

## v1.1.3 (2026-04-15)

**[New Feature]** Multi-session support with per-conversation AI configuration.
- Each conversation can now be configured with its own AI gateway, model, system prompt, and temperature
- New conversation settings panel accessible from the chat screen
- Server-side conversation config storage with REST API (`/api/conversations/:id/config`)
- Gateway-authoritative model and skill queries — available models are fetched directly from the connected AI backend

**[New Feature]** Gateway selector for new conversations.
- Card-style UI with guided text for choosing which AI backend to use
- Displays connected account IDs with visual indicators

**[Enhancement]** Complete internationalization (i18n) for all screens.
- Full English/Chinese localization for settings, password change, and edge-case pages
- Global AppBar title centering and consistent font sizing (18sp)

**[Enhancement]** Desktop UI polish.
- Conversation list header alignment and spacing adjustments
- Unified AppBar actions padding across all screens
- Conversation settings sheet with full-screen system prompt editor

**[Bug Fix]** Fix cross-conversation message leakage — thinking blocks and messages now correctly route by `conversation_id`.

**[Bug Fix]** Fix port conflict detection on startup to prevent multiple frpc instances from spawning.

**[Bug Fix]** Fix Android 11+ unable to open privacy policy and terms of service links.

**[Architecture]** Server-side conversation auto-creation — conversations are now created server-side when a new `account_id` is first seen, removing client-side race conditions.
